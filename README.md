# liri-node-app

This is a console-based node app that accepts one of four commands and an argument, and performs four different respective functions:

"concert-this [musical artist]" will return the nearest upcoming concert venue for that artist.

"movie-this [film title]" will return numerous factors of the given film.

"spotify-this [song title]" will return a few parameters of the song (including a link to a preview of the song).

"do-what-it-says" reads the singular line in "random.txt" and employs it as a command, enacting one of the other three functions.
